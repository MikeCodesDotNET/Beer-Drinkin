Beer Drinkin is a .NET beer tracking app for iOS using Xamarin and Azure. Powered by several Microsoft services such as Microsoft's Azure App Services, Cognitive Services, and Azure Search as well as HockeyApp and Xamarin Test Cloud.

It is designed to showcase both Xamarin's cross-platform capability and the magic of using Azure to build scalable, feature rich applications. The project is still actively developed with a comprehensive set of features.

### Get Involved
Want to contribute? Great!

Grab a copy of the project and start tweaking, fixing bugs and adding new features. First merged PR will receive a crate of beer (location allowing) as a thank you. 

## Community built version
I am focused entirely on the backend infrastructure and traditional version of the apps. If you want to see how to build this type of app with Xamarin.Forms, then please check out the community build version (within the Forms folder). 

#### Design
I've created the designs using Sketch.app which is a Mac only application. As part of my workflow, these are shared with [Zeplin](http://zeplin.io) which I'm happy to grant access to.
